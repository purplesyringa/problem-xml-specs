# 3. Types

Although we can talk about compilation and invocation abstractly, it is sometimes desirable to know what language a program is written in and what machine can run that program, and act on that information.

This is done by assigning types to source, executable, and raw files.

A type is an ASCII string containing fields spearated by dots `.`.

Source types contain information about what language and compiler the files are written for and what their formats are. Examples of source types, in increasing order of complexity:

- `python`, `c`,
- `python.cpython`, `c.gcc`,
- `python=3.cpython`, `c=90.gcc`,
- `python=3-7.cpython`, `c=90.gcc=9-4-0`,
- `c=90.gcc=9-4-0.amd64`,
- `c=90.gcc=9-4-0.amd64.linux`.

Formally, the full form of a source type looks like `{LANGUAGE}={LANGUAGE-VERSION}.{IMPLEMENTATION}={IMPLEMENTATION-VERSION}.{ARCH}.{PLATFORM}`. As the dot sign is already used, the dots in version fields MUST be replaced with dashes. For languages with multiple file kinds (e.g. C headers), `-{KIND}` is appended to the language field.

Executable types have a similar format, though they usually don't contain a version. The full form of an executable type is `{KIND}.{FORMAT}={FORMAT-VERSION}.{ARCH}.{PLATFORM}`, where `{KIND}` is one of the following:

- `exe` for stand-alone executables, e.g. normal applications,
- `dylib` for dynamically linked libraries,
- `obj` for object files, e.g. statically linked libraries or archives.

The `.{ARCH}.{PLATFORM}` or `.{PLATFORM}` suffix can be omitted for some formats, just like `={FORMAT-VERSION}`.

Raw, non-executable types that don't depend on the architecture (e.g. ZIP archives) use the syntax `raw.{FORMAT}`.


## 3.1. Masks

However, such accuracy is seldom needed. Therefore some fields can be omitted, and versions can be specified less rigidly. When a field is omitted, it is allowed to contain any value. If necessary, an explicit wildcard can be used: `python` is the same as `python=*.*=*.*.*`.

Versions can include wildcards in the middle, e.g. `python=3-7-*` or `c=gnu-*`. Additionally, simple inequalities can be used for the version, matching those used by NPM, Cargo, and other package managers:

- The equal sign `=` indicates an exact version: `python=3-6-9` and `python=3-8-10` mean versions 3.6.9 and 3.8.10 respectively,
- The greater-than-or-equal-to sign `>=` indicates everything starting with the given version: `python>=3-6-9` includes both 3.6.9, 3.6.10, 3.7.1, and 4.1.2,
- The `>`, `<`, `<=`, and `!=` signs work as well,
- The caret sign `^` is like `>=`, but the first number (major version) cannot be changed: `python^3-6-9` includes 3.6.9, 3.6.10, and 3.7.1, but not 4.1.2,
- The tilde sign `~` is like `^`, but the first two numbers (major and minor versions) cannot be changed: `python~3-6-9` includes 3.6.9 and 3.6.10, but not 3.7.1 or 4.1.2.

In all cases, comparison is lexicographic: the version is split by `-` into fields, and purely numeric fields are compared as integers. If a string and a number are in the same position, the string is considered less than the number.

There are two slightly different contexts in which types are used. Firstly, there are user submissions and problem-wide programs, like checkers. In this case, you provide a **rigid type**. Secondly, there are cases when a mask is needed, like with graders: the same grader should work for all implementations of C++. In this case, a **wildcard type** is provided.

For example, a checker written in C++ should perhaps use the type `cpp=17.gcc`, while a grader might use `cpp>=14`. The bounds are, unfortunately, often unclear: while a checker written in Python might use the type `python~3-8-10.cpython`, that would be too limiting: some judges might have slightly older or newer versions of Python installed, so it would probably be better to use `python^3-6.cpython` or alike for a checker, and `python^3-6` or alike for a grader.

If masks match several types supported by the judge, the default implementation MUST be preferred if the judge is aware of the language, and if there are still multiple types left, the newest version of the language MUST be chosen.


## 3.2. Supported platforms

The rarely used fields `{ARCH}` and `{PLATFORM}` in the mask may have the following values:

`{ARCH}`:

- `amd64` for amd64 (x86-64),
- `i386` for x86,
- self-describing: `arm64`, `armel`, `armhf`, `mipsel`, `mips64el`, `ppc64el`, `s390x`.

`{PLATFORM}`:

- `nt` for Windows NT,
- `linux` for Linux,
- `darwin` for macOS,
- `netbsd` for NetBSD,
- `freebsd` for FreeBSD,
- `openbsd` for OpenBSD,
- `systemv` for System V,
- `hurd` for GNU Hurd.
